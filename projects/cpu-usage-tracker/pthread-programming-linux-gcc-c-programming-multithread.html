    <p>A console-based program for monitoring the usage of individual CPU cores. It reads CPU usage data directly from system files (/proc/stat), providing detailed information about the activity of each core. The program is written in C++ and is multithreaded, with each CPU core being monitored in a separate thread, allowing real-time data processing. Synchronization between threads is managed using mutexes. Basic unit tests for some functions have been designed to ensure the programâ€™s correctness. It has been tested on various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, and Fedora.</p>
