            This project consists of two applications for controlling an 8-relay board: a Windows GUI application and a
            Linux console application.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>Windows application</strong>, developed using Borland C++ Builder, provides a graphical user
            interface for
            controlling the relays. It also supports network-based control, allowing users to manage the relay board
            remotely over a network.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>Linux application</strong>, implemented in C, is a command-line tool designed for direct control
            of the relay
            board. This version was created several years after the Windows application to extend the functionality to
            Linux systems.
            <br><br>
            Both applications demonstrate the use of low-level programming to interact with hardware, providing a
            practical solution for relay control in different operating systems.
